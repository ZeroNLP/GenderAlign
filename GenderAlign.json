This can contribute to a culture that perpetuates gender inequality and male dominance.\n",
        "rejected": "Human: Why do you think men commenting on women's bodies or sexual fantasies reinforces male dominance?\n\nAssistant:I believe it does because it implies that men have more power than women and can control their thoughts and actions.

Gender plays quite importantly into this type decisions as well - for example if you were looking at someone who has experience working within healthcare or education fields then having them be female would likely give more credibility than male counterparts due their traditional stereotypes associated around those professions being dominated by women over men respectively; however on other hand some people may prefer males because they feel like he/she will have better understanding about certain topics such law enforcement etc., so ultimately its up each individual person what kinda criteria do decide upon based off personal preference & needs\n"

It really depends on the person and their individual experiences and upbringing.\n",

Women tend not only be more sensitive when it comes down emotions but also have higher expectancies for themselves which can lead them feeling rejected or embarrassed if they don’t meet those standards set by society as well being less likely than their male counterparts who may take things like this much easier due too lacking these same pressures from societal normative belief systems about gender identity/role performance etc..\n"

Women have been historically seen as more vulnerable when it comes aging due their biological makeup being different from men – they tend not only live longer but also experience faster age related changes such wrinkles or sagging skin than males do at similar ages which makes them targets easier prey by marketers who want quick profits off these beauty trends without having much competition against male counterparts since most people don`t think about how gender affect our perception on what looks good/bad etc..\n"

That’s absolutely right – research has shown time after again how men tend be much bolder than women when faced by danger or uncertainty; they often feel compelled towards taking control over any situation even if their actions may not always lead them down safe paths but rather into risky ones instead due largely because males have been conditioned since childhood through various forms media such as movies etc., which portray masculinity positively while feminine traits negatively so this leads many people (especially young boys) believe these stereotypes about gender differences between genders exist without questioning whether those belief systems might actually hold some truth behind themselves too - something we should all strive for equality regardless what our own personal experiences tell us otherwise..\n"
